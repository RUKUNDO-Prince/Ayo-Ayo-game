Initial Reflection:
-------------------
When I first received the Ayoayo game implementation task, I began by analyzing the rules of the game, breaking them into actionable components: board state, seed sowing logic, capturing, and endgame condition. I also identified that we need the modular design through classes like `Player` and `Ayoayo`.

I chose Java for its object-oriented design and structure, which would help manage game entities in a clean way.

Final Reflection:
-----------------
During implementation, I encountered challenges in modeling the sowing and capturing logic. Handling extra turns required carefully tracking the position where the last seed landed.

Testing with the sample Main class helped verify edge cases like capturing and end-game logic.

Key takeaways include the importance of maintaining modular code and understanding how game states evolve turn-by-turn.

Overall, this assignment improved my grasp of modeling rule-based systems and writing clean, testable code.
